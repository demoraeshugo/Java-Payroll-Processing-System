# Java-Payroll-Processing-System

## Project Description

In this project, you will develop a Payroll Processing System to process the payments to the employees in a company.
For simplicity, the system will not process the possible deduction items in the paychecks.Your project shall processthe command lines entered on the console and display the output on the console. The command lines include the instructions for adding/removing an employee, calculating the payments, printing the earning statements, and managing the working hours of the part time employees.

Let‚Äôs assume the system maintains an employee database, which may include 3 different types of employees: full time,
part time and management. Note that an employee with a management role is also a full-time employee. You are required
to implement an array-based container class to hold the employee database. Every employee in the database has a profile,
including the employee‚Äôs name, department and the date hired, assuming there are 3 departments in the company:
‚Äúcomputer science‚Äù, ‚Äúelectrical and computer engineering‚Äù and ‚Äúinformation technology‚Äù. The payroll is processed every
other week. Calculation of the payments are different depending on an employee‚Äôs employment type.
